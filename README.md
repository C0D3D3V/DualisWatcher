### Setup
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) >2.12
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) >3.6
3. `pip install beautifulsoup4`
4. `pip install pygments`
5. run `python main.py --init`

### Usage
- `python main.py`
    - Fetches the current state of your Dualis Account, saves it and detects any changes.
    - If configured, it also sends out a mail-notification.
    - It doesn't print out any console output, but it writes `DualisWatcher.log`.
- `pythin main.py --init`
    - Guides you trough the configuration of the software, including the activation of mail-notifications and obtainment of a login-token for your Dualis-Account.
    - It prints all information into the console.
- `python main.py --new-token`
    - Overrides the login-token with a newly obtained one.
    - Use it if at any point in time, for whatever reason, the saved token gets rejected by Dualis.
    - Doesn't change any of the other settings (contrary to `--init`).
    - It prints all information into the console.

### Notes
- Use a separate E-Mail - Account for sending out the notifications, as its login data is saved in cleartext.
- The Login-Information for your Dualis-Account is save, it isn't saved in any way. Only a Login-Token is saved.
